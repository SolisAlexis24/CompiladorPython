### Instructions to execute de code
You need to have Python installed on your computer to be able to run the code.

**NOTE:** A Python library called PLY was used to create the parser, but don't worry, all the files needed to make it work are already included in this repository.

If you want to know more information about the PLY library you can access the following link
- PLY Files: (https://github.com/dabeaz/ply)
- PLY Documentation: (https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html)

Then open a terminal and move to the folder in which the files are located

#### For Windows
Excute de code using the command **_python parsero.py_**
#### For Linux
Excute de code using the command **_python3 parsero.py_**

After executing the command described above, depending on your operating system, the program will ask you for the name of the file in which the parser will be made, the file is **_c.xd_** (you will need to enter the name and extension)

You will get as a result whether the parser was successful or not.

**NOTE:** If you want to run a different string to test the compiler's operation, you need to edit the file **_c.xd_**
